NEOLOG 1.0.0 - Notes

The goal of this web app is to create a centered site to create tasks and create the proper documentation
for NEO Department. We don't have any other medium to really see our impact, work and everything we really
do day-to-day basis.

With this tool, we will be able to demonstrate our tasks, MOP's, calls, SO, Outage Troubleshooting and more.
At this moment we work in every aspect of the company which is not logged therefore no one know what we do
all the time.

Is really simple Web App, First the Technician have to create a user and password to login to their dashboard
no other person only the technician and our Supervisor Ricardo Torres can see all the info, no co-worker can add
modify or delete any other user data, this "Full Access" is only for the supervisor and the developer which
can't edit,modify or delete any data the admin only can see the graphs and tasks.

-Weekly chart of tasks done per technician, work time for each task and the status(closed/open/stalled)
-Stall means the task is waiting for an outside source to complete something that is out of our hand.
-Ricardo will approved that the task was real and was worked as documented.
-This tool can help Neo Data and gave a chance to be rightfully performance reviews.
-This will be developed by Ramon Rivera, in his spare time and home. And is hoped to be implemented in January, 2019.
