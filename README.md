# network_tool

Written in Python using Flask, Junos Pyez, tikapy, Paramiko and SQL.
The goal is to create a tool for monitoring, automate and other micro-tools for junos devices, mikrotik and cisco

Also i am developing an API for the tool, it will be easier to code importing the modules. Cleaner code i guess

Im pretty far far far away from the main goal but whatever i am a newbie and i am killing it.
